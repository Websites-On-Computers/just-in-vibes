A fully functional todo list app. It should have:
- An input field with a placeholder "What needs to be done?"
- An "Add" button next to the input
- A list of todos below, each with a checkbox to mark complete and a delete button
- Completed todos should have a strikethrough style
- A footer showing the count of remaining items
- All state managed in JavaScript, no external dependencies
- Clean minimal design with subtle shadows and rounded corners
